Work:
  ☐ way to show all notes available or at least per server. this is the case when there are notes available but the app is not avaialble (deleted) @high @midterm 
  ☐ copy/merge notes from one app to another @high  @shortterm 
  ☐ deleting server to delete all notes as well? @high @midterm 
  ☐ show number of apps available @shortterm @high 
  ☐ create app(s) @longterm @low   
  ☐ spend some time on the design ... overall
    ☐ check the responsiveness (doesn't seems to work)  
  ✔ Implement local storage (https://github.com/RobinCK/vue-ls) @midterm @critical @done(18-09-30 08:20)
  ✔ Error messages and logic - when connecting to core instance, when receiving data from core etc @shortterm @high @done(18-10-01 06:07)  
  ✔ change the code textbox with `codemirror`/`monaco`. What are the benefits and performance implications @midterm @high @done(18-09-24 13:24)  
  
Investigate/Think:
  ☐ re-think the tables-and-fields feature @longterm @low 
  ☐ think about how to handle shortcuts - navigate between apps, notes and in-note (run, cancel, move up/down, delete etc), collapse/expand all etc @shortterm @high 
  ☐ think about how(if) to use url parameters
  ☐ what permanent data storage can be used and how. Server component? Mongo? Security? Multi-user? etc.
  ☐ how to ship everything as containers (incuding the server side and database)
  ☐ investigate how to add Qlik as a language for the `monaco` editor (at the moment it defaults to `sql`)
  ☐ Electron??? @longterm @low
